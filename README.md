## About DITA XML

DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) is an XML-based standard for creating structured content. It is widely used in technical writing for authoring, managing, and delivering documentation. This repository demonstrates my ability to create clean, well-organized technical content following the DITA standard.
