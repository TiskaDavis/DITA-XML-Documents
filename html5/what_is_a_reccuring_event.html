        <p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">recurring event</strong> is an event that repeats at regular intervals over time,
            eliminating the need to create separate entries for each occurrence manually. Recurring
            events are commonly used for activities or commitments that follow a predictable
            schedule, such as weekly meetings, monthly appointments, or daily reminders. The
            calendar allows you to set the frequency of repetition, including:</p>
        <ul class="ul" id="what_is_a_reccuring_event__ul_c5l_n2w_zdc">
            <li class="li">Daily: The event repeats every day.</li>
            <li class="li">Weekly: The event occurs on the same day(s) each week.</li>
            <li class="li">Monthly: The event repeats on a specific date or day of the month.</li>
            <li class="li">Yearly: The event occurs annually on the same date.</li>
            <li class="li">Custom: Users can define specific intervals (e.g., every 2 weeks or every 3
                months).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">You can set an end date for the recurring series (e.g., "Repeat until December 31, 2024")
            or choose to repeat indefinitely.</p>
